<h1>CS585 Homework 5</h1>
<h3>Name: Justin Janice</h3>
<h3>Teammates: Tabitha Oanda, Praneeth Chandra Bogineni </h3>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>For the bat dataset we take the coordinates given to us and utilize the Kalman filter to track their movement through all the frames. For the cells dataset we must localize and segment all of the cells in each of the frames, and use 
    the coordinates recieved from this to put into the Kalman filter once again to track the movement of the cells through the frames. 
</p>

<h3>Localization and Segmentation</h3>
<p> We used the localization and segmentation given on the course website for the bats dataset. We created our own localization and segmentation for the cells dataset, which included initially taking the grayscale images and making them binary images through thresholding to try and separate the cells from the background.
    Next we eroded and then dilated the frames to try and remove any noise and only have the cells in the frame, and finally find the contours in the frames to see the outline of the cells. In order to obtain the x and y coordinates we find the mean of the x and y values of the contours.

<h3>A challenging situation where the tracker succeeds</h3>
<p>Bats: We track the majority of the bats and draw the paths where the bats had traveled. We also do a good job not allowing for tracks to switch when two bats fly past eachother.</p>
<p>Cells: If we include a process noise covariance matrix then we were able to track fewer cells, but were able to better track those cells than without the process noise covariance matrix. This means we were able to draw longer paths for these few cells 
   although they were moving very erratically.
</p>

<h3>A challenging situation where the tracker fails</h3>
<p>Bats: When the bats begin flying too fast then it becomes difficult to track them, but I feel this could be fixed if we had access to velocity measurements for the bats because then we could better predict how far they would move in between frames.</p>
<p>Cells: We had a hard time tracking the cells in general with the Kalman filter because of how erratically the cells moved so it became hard to predict where they would end up in the next frame. As stated above this was slightly 
    improved when a process noise covariance matrix was included but then less cells were able to be tracked. It may be better to try and track the cells without a Kalman filter due to how difficult it is to track erratic movement using a Kalman filter. 
</p>

<h3> New Tracks and Terminating Tracks</h3>
<p>New Tracks: At the start we create a new Kalman filter and track for every object that can be seen in the initial frame, and then we begin to make position estimates for each of our objects and try to match those estimates with measurements for objects in the subsequent frames that are below a cost threshold. 
    If we find measurements to match with the estimates then we can begin adding the measurements to the history of the objects which we can then use to draw the paths once we have enough values in the history.  We create a new Kalman filter and track for objects that have a measurement that can not 
    be matched with any position estimate for an object from the previous frame, and then continue the process of tracking for this new object as well as all previous objects that have not been lost.  
</p>
<p>Terminating Tracks: When there is no measurement under the cost theshold for a given position estimate then we will increment the objects miss counter, and treat our position estimate as a measurement, and then continue making new estimates. If we keep having zero measurements that can matched with the position estimates
    then we will continue to increment the objects miss counter. 
    We will continue this process until we meet a threshold for the miss counter which will tell us that the object has been missing for too many frames and at that point we will consider the object as lost and no longer try and track it.  
</p>

<h3>When objects touch and occulde</h3>
<p>If two objects touch then we continue to make an estimate of the position of the object by treating the previous estimate as a measurement. We would continue to try and make estimates until the objects are no longer occulding. Once the objects are past eachother we can try to then
    once again associate the objects position estimates with measurements that are under the threshold for our cost function. This will allow us to essentially move past the period of the objects occulding and allow them to continue on their correct track rather than accidentally allowing for one object to switch
    to the path of another object because we won't be trying to match measurements but instead continue making estimates based off of the information we already have collected until we can safely say the objects are no longer touching. 
</p>

<h3>Spurious measurements</h3>
<p>If there is a spurious measurement then we try to predict its next position, but since this was a spurious measurement there will be no actual measurement in the next frame to associate the objects estimated position with that has a cost below the threshold. Our draw function has 
    a threshold where an object needs a certain number of postions in its history before its path will actually begin to be drawn. Since spurious measurements should not meet that history thereshold, their paths will never be drawn. This object will just be considered as lost. </p>

<h3>Advantages and drawbacks of different kinematic models</h3>
<p>The Kalman filter works very well on the bats because the trajectory of the bats is very consistent which makes their paths quite predictable. Having velocity will be useful for the bats because the bats are consistent in the direction that they are moving so having the 
    velocity makes it easier to predict where the bats will be in subsequent frames. The cells move very erratically so this makes it very difficult to predict where they will be in subsequent frames. Since the cells move so erratically it makes 
    it difficult to utilize the velocity because the direction is always changing for the cells, so you can't really say they will move a certain distance in a certain direction because their velocity is a certain value since their direction might change rapidly making the velocity
    not nearly as useful. </p>
